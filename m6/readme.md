To install Altar:
1. Flash atlar2.0.ino to ESP32
2. Run main.py
3. Set up Altar hardware and power on ESP32
4. Open up index.html in browser of choice (I recommend not using chrome, because of issues with audio autoplay) - you will need to download 'loop.mp4' from here and move it to the same folder as everything else (too large for github)
6. Enjoy :-)
